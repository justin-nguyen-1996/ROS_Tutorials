Creating a ROS workspace and packages
======================================
1. Create a folder that will act as the ROS workspace
2. Create an src/ folder inside the workspace
3. Run catkin_make in the top-level directory
4. Make a folder inside src/ that will act as the package:
   `cd src/`
   `catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2]`
5. Re-run catkin_make in the top-level directory
6. Add the workspace to the ROS environment: `. devel/setup.bash`


Running a ROS program/package
==============================
1. Start the ROS master: `roscore`
2. To run an executable (node): `rosrun <package> <node>` or `rosrun <package> <node> __name:=<new name>`
3. To see the ROS computational tree: `rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph`
